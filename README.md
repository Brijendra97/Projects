# Projects
This repository contains some Machine Learning and OpenCV projects.

1. Air Drawing with OpenCV :
In this project, I build an Air Canvas which can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of a colored marker with a camera.We will be using                                the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project. The preferred language is Python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use                                    syntax but understanding the basics it can be implemented in any OpenCV supported language.
